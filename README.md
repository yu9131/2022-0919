Colons can be used to align columns.



| Tables | Are | Cool |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| col 3 is |right-aligned|$1600|
col 2 is|centered|$12|
zebra stripes    | are neat     | $1     |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (I) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.


| Markdown| Less| Pretty|
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Still    | `renders`  | nicely   |
|     1    |     2    |  3|
